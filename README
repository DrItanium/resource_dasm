Realmz is a fantasy role-playing game for Windows and classic Mac OS. realmz_dasm is a disassembler for Realmz scenarios; it produces annotated maps of all land and dungeon levels, as well as descriptions of all events and encounters that may occur in the scenario.

To use realmz_dasm:
- Install Netpbm (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/).
- Build and install phosg (https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/phosg).
- Build realmz_dasm (run `make`) and put it in the same directory as Realmz.
- Run disassemble_all.sh in that directory.
This will produce a directory named "Disassembly" containing some very large image files (maps of all the land and dungeon levels), the scenario script, and the resources contained in each scenario (icons, sounds, text).



resource_dump is a disassembler for classic Mac OS resource forks. realmz_dasm uses it to parse tile images to produce map images, but resource_dump can also be used by itself.

Building resource_dump is the same as above. resource_dump can extract raw resources from any file's resource fork and decode some resources into modern formats:
- Converts cicns to bmp files. May fail on cicns with nonstandard sizes or formats.
- Converts PICTs to bmp files. May fail on PICTs containing unusual opcodes.
- Converts ICON, ics#/4/8, and icl4/8 resources to bmp files.
- Converts snd resources to wav files.
- Converts TEXT resources to txt files with Unix line endings.
Run resource_dump without any arguments for usage information.
